Research project at MSU about multitask Transformer-based language models and my 4th year graduation paper

Anyone interested in joining the research & contributing to the project is welcome! It's planned to release a paper on the results of the research (alongside graduation project), so I'd be happy to have coauthors. If you are interested, please contact me by email pogorelcevsa@gmail.com or in Telegram https://t.me/s1m00n
